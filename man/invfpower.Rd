\title{Back-transform folded-power-transformed scores to the unit interval [0,1]}
\usage{
invfpower(y, lambda = 1, scaling = "plus_minus_1")
}
\arguments{
\item{y}{A numeric vector of folded-power-transformed scores}

\item{lambda}{Numeric value of the applied power transformation, which can range between 0 (limiting case: logit transformation) and 1 (no transformation)}

\item{scaling}{Character string indicating whether scores were re-expressed to the [-1, 1] interval (\code{plus_minus_1}) or not (\code{free})}
}
\value{
A numeric vector
}
\description{
This function takes as input a vector of transformed scores, i.e. values that were originally in the unit interval [0, 1] but which were re-expressed using Tukey's folded power transformation. It allows back-transformation of two versions of folded powers: Those that are mapped to the [-1, +1] interval and those that aren't.

  seq(-1, 1, .1),
  lambda = .14,
  scaling = "plus_minus_1")
